Refine typography, spacing, and add final polish touches. This is a refinement pass - make subtle improvements without major changes.

TYPOGRAPHY REFINEMENTS:

1. Headlines:
   - Increase font weight contrast: H1 should be 800, H2 should be 700
   - Adjust letter-spacing on large headlines: -0.02em for tighter, more premium look
   - Ensure consistent headline hierarchy throughout site
   - Add subtle gradient to main hero headline: dark blue to slightly lighter blue (vertical)

2. Body Text:
   - Increase line-height to 1.7 for improved readability
   - Slightly increase paragraph spacing: 1.5rem between paragraphs
   - Optimize font size for readability: 16-18px base, 14-16px on mobile
   - Ensure consistent text colors: primary text should be same shade throughout

3. Service Descriptions:
   - "Best for" text should be styled distinctly: smaller, italic, lighter color
   - Ensure descriptions are left-aligned for better scanability
   - Add subtle divider between title and description

4. Pull Quotes / Emphasis Text:
   - Italic text should be slightly larger than surrounding text
   - Add subtle left border to blockquotes: 3px teal line
   - Increase padding around emphasized content

SPACING & LAYOUT POLISH:

1. Section Padding:
   - Ensure consistent vertical spacing: 96px desktop, 64px mobile
   - Adjust spacing between section title and content: 48px standard
   - Create breathing room around CTAs: 32px padding

2. Grid Alignment:
   - Ensure all cards/elements align to consistent grid
   - Check that columns line up across different sections
   - Verify mobile stack order makes logical sense

3. White Space:
   - Increase white space around important CTAs
   - Reduce crowding in dense text areas
   - Add strategic negative space to draw eye to key elements

VISUAL POLISH:

1. Shadows:
   - Standardize shadow depths: use 3-4 consistent shadow levels
   - Light shadows for cards: rgba(0,0,0,0.05), 10px blur
   - Medium shadows for elevated elements: rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 20px blur
   - Deep shadows for hover states: rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 30px blur

2. Borders & Lines:
   - Ensure consistent border radius throughout: 12px for cards, 8px for buttons
   - Border colors should be consistent: use rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.3) for teal borders
   - Remove any accidental double borders

3. Colors:
   - Audit all colors for consistency
   - Ensure sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
   - Teal accents should use exact same hex value throughout
   - Background blues should be consistent shade

4. Icons:
   - Ensure all icons are same visual weight
   - Consistent sizing: service icons 32px, small icons 20px
   - All icons should align to grid properly

MOBILE REFINEMENTS:

1. Typography:
   - Reduce headline sizes by 20-30% on mobile
   - Ensure minimum 16px font size for body text (iOS zoom prevention)
   - Adjust line height: slightly tighter on mobile for better vertical space usage

2. Spacing:
   - Reduce section padding on mobile to 48px
   - Ensure adequate tap targets: minimum 44x44px
   - Check that form inputs have comfortable spacing

3. Layout:
   - Verify all elements stack logically on narrow screens
   - Ensure no horizontal scroll on any screen size
   - Check that images scale appropriately

ACCESSIBILITY FINAL CHECKS:

- All interactive elements have focus states
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Alt text present on all images
- Form labels properly associated
- Headings follow semantic hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Tailwind utility classes where possible
- Maintain existing responsive breakpoints
- Test on multiple screen sizes: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1920px
- Ensure changes don't affect page load performance

DO NOT:
- Change any content or copy
- Alter fundamental layout structure
- Add new components or sections
- Change color scheme (only standardize existing colors)

Goal: Achieve pixel-perfect polish and professional consistency throughout.
