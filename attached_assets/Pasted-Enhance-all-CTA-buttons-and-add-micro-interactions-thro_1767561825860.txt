TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Framer Motion for complex animations
- Use CSS transitions for simple hover effects
- Ensure all animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Test performance on mobile devices
- Maintain existing button functionality (links work correctly)

DO NOT:
- Change button text or calls-to-action
- Alter button positions or layout
- Add new buttons
- Change color scheme beyond specified enhancements

Ensure all interactions feel polished and intentional, not gimmicky.
