Add scroll-triggered animations and improve visual flow between sections. Do not change content or layout.

SCROLL ANIMATIONS:

1. Global Fade-In Pattern:
   - All major sections fade in and slide up (20px) when entering viewport
   - Use Framer Motion's whileInView trigger
   - Timing: 0.6s ease-out
   - Threshold: trigger when 20% of element is visible
   - Animate once: true (don't repeat on scroll up/down)

2. Section-Specific Animations:

   "What We Do" Section:
   - Section title fades in first
   - Intro paragraph fades in 200ms after title
   - Service cards animate in sequence (already covered in Prompt 2)

   "Why TALINTEL" Section:
   - Main headline fades in with slight scale effect (95% to 100%)
   - Four benefit cards fade in sequentially, 100ms stagger
   - Outcome text fades in last

   "For Candidates" Section:
   - Left content (text) slides in from left
   - Right content (dark box) slides in from right
   - Both meet in middle, 0.6s duration

   "About TALINTEL" Section:
   - Values cards fade in with rotation effect (start at -5deg, end at 0deg)
   - Stagger: 150ms between cards
   - Story text paragraph fades in smoothly

   Founder Section:
   - Image fades in from left
   - Text content fades in from right
   - Pull quote scales up slightly (starts 95%, ends 100%)

3. Visual Separators:
   - Add subtle gradient dividers between major sections
   - Dividers fade in when entering viewport
   - Use teal to transparent gradient, 1px height

4. Background Depth:
   - Alternate section backgrounds: white → very light blue → white
   - Transitions should be seamless with gradient overlays
   - Creates visual rhythm without harsh boundaries

PARALLAX EFFECTS (Subtle):

1. Hero Section:
   - Background elements move slightly slower than foreground on scroll
   - Effect: 0.3 multiplier (very subtle, not dizzy-inducing)
   - Only on desktop (disable on mobile)

2. Section Backgrounds:
   - Very subtle parallax on alternating sections
   - Maximum 10-20px movement
   - Must not affect readability

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:

- Use will-change CSS property sparingly
- Implement intersection observer for scroll triggers
- Lazy load animations (don't run until needed)
- Reduce motion for users with prefers-reduced-motion
- Test scroll performance: 60fps target

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Framer Motion's viewport detection
- Maintain existing scroll behavior
- Ensure mobile performance is smooth
- Keep animations consistent with brand (professional, not flashy)

DO NOT:
- Add new content or sections
- Change section order
- Alter spacing dramatically
- Create jarring or distracting animations

Goal: Create smooth, elegant flow that guides user through content naturally.
