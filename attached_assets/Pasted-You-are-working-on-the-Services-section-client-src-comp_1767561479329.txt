You are working on the Services section (client/src/components/sections/Services.tsx). Enhance the existing hover interactions and visual effects. The code already has good structure - we're polishing it further.

CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:
- Already has: hover shadow, translate-y, group hover, motion animations ✓
- Already has: Core offering distinction with accent color ✓
- Already has: Icon background color transition ✓

ENHANCEMENTS TO ADD:

1. Strengthen Hover Effect:
   Current: hover:shadow-xl hover:-translate-y-2
   Change to: hover:shadow-2xl hover:-translate-y-3
   Add: hover:scale-[1.02] (subtle scale for depth)
   Keep: transition-all duration-300

2. Core Offering Enhancement:
   Current: border-l-accent ring-1 ring-accent/20
   Add on hover: ring-accent/40 (intensify ring on hover)
   Add: subtle glow effect with box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.2)
   Make "Core Offering" badge more prominent:
   - Increase font size to text-[11px]
   - Add subtle drop shadow to badge
   - Consider: rounded-sm instead of sharp corners

3. Icon Animation Enhancement:
   Current: Icon changes color on group hover
   Add: transform scale-110 and rotate-6 on group hover
   Example: group-hover:scale-110 group-hover:rotate-6
   Keep: smooth transition-all duration-300

4. Title Enhancement:
   Current: group-hover:text-accent
   Add: Add subtle underline that slides in on hover
   Use: after pseudo-element with width animation
   Or simply: underline decoration-accent decoration-2 underline-offset-4 on hover

5. Stagger Animation Refinement:
   Current delay: index * 0.1
   Change to: index * 0.15 (slightly more noticeable stagger)
   Keep everything else the same

6. "Best for" Text Styling:
   Current: text-primary font-semibold text-sm uppercase
   Add distinctive styling:
   - Wrap in a subtle background: bg-gray-50 px-2 py-1 rounded
   - Or add a top border: border-t border-gray-200 pt-3 mt-3
   - Or make it italic: italic text-xs
   Choose whichever looks best with existing design

7. Card Border Enhancement:
   Current: border-l-4 with secondary/accent
   On hover: make border slightly glow or pulse
   Add: transition-colors to the border itself

MOBILE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Reduce hover:-translate-y to hover:-translate-y-1 on mobile
   - Remove scale effect on mobile (< md breakpoint)
   - Ensure cards don't overlap on small screens
   - Keep tap feedback: active:scale-[0.98]

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Use existing Tailwind classes where possible
   - Maintain existing Framer Motion setup
   - Keep existing group hover pattern
   - Test that all animations are smooth (60fps)
   - Ensure animations respect prefers-reduced-motion

ACCESSIBILITY:
   - Ensure focus states are visible (add focus:ring-2 focus:ring-accent)
   - Maintain keyboard navigation
   - Keep existing semantic HTML structure

DO NOT:
   - Change the card grid layout (keep grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)
   - Alter service descriptions or titles
   - Change the icon set
   - Modify the bottom quote section
   - Add new services or remove existing ones
   - Change fundamental spacing or padding

RESULT EXPECTATIONS:
   - Cards should feel more premium and interactive
   - Core offerings should clearly stand out
   - Hover states should feel polished and intentional
   - Mobile experience remains smooth
   - Overall: subtle but noticeable improvement

Test the changes and ensure they enhance rather than distract from the content.
