Headline: About TALINTEL
Subsection: WHO WE ARE
"TALINTEL is a consulting and advisory firm focused on talent intelligence and execution. We operate at the intersection of data, systems, and leadership to help companies hire with confidence in competitive and uncertain markets."
Subsection: OUR FOUNDER
Layout: Photo on left (250x250px, rounded corners), bio text on right
Photo placeholder: [Professional photo of Ryan MacDougall]
Bio Text: "Ryan MacDougall is a senior talent operator and advisor with deep experience building and scaling hiring systems in complex, global environments. Throughout his career, he has led talent functions, advised executive teams, and partnered closely with founders and leaders navigating periods of growth, transformation, and constraint.
Ryan's background spans both startups and Fortune 500 companies, giving him unique insight into how hiring strategies must adapt to different business realities. He has led and developed teams across North America, Europe, and APAC, shaping global talent operations that balance local nuance with organizational scale.
An expatriate who has lived and worked in both North America and Europe, Ryan brings a deep appreciation for the role culture plays — not just across geographies, but within companies themselves. His work is grounded in one principle: hiring decisions must hold up in practice, not just on paper."
Subsection: OUR STORY
"TALINTEL started from a pattern Ryan kept seeing. Companies were investing heavily in hiring: buying tools, running searches, and building teams. Yet they were still making slow, inconsistent decisions that didn’t hold up under pressure.
The problem wasn’t effort or budget. It was clarity.
Hiring teams were drowning in data but starving for insight. Leaders had opinions but no shared framework. Processes existed on paper but broke down in practice. And when markets shifted or urgency hit, systems that looked fine in theory collapsed.
TALINTEL was built to fix that. Not by adding more tools or theory, but by bringing structure, intelligence, and execution to the parts of hiring that actually determine outcomes—how decisions get made, how quickly teams can move, and whether the system performs when it matters.
We work with companies where hiring isn’t a volume game. It’s a precision problem, where every role is critical, every mishire is expensive, and the margin for error is low.
Our approach is simple: see the market clearly, decide with confidence, and execute without waste."
Subsection: WHAT WE STAND FOR
