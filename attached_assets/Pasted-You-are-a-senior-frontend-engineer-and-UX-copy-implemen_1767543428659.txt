You are a senior frontend engineer and UX copy implementation assistant.
Context
Website: talintel.ai
Goal: Update the homepage copy only, using the text provided below.
Constraint: Do not redesign the site. Do not change layout, structure, navigation, or styling beyond what is required to fit the new copy cleanly.
Treat this as a content replacement task, not a creative rewrite.
Non-Negotiable Rules

Do NOT invent new sections, pages, or features
Do NOT add backend functionality
Do NOT rename navigation items unless explicitly instructed
Do NOT alter CSS except for minor spacing fixes if text overflows
Preserve existing HTML structure wherever possible
If a section already exists, replace its copy with the provided copy
If a CTA already exists, rename it as instructed but keep the same button/link
If something is unclear, default to minimal change


TASK
Replace the existing homepage copy with the following content, section by section, mapping it to the current homepage structure.

HEADER / NAV
Keep structure exactly the same.
Text should read:

TALINTEL
What We Do
Why TALINTEL
For Candidates
About
Contact

If there is a primary CTA button in the header, label it:
"Schedule a 30-minute diagnostic"

HERO SECTION
Replace hero copy with:
Headline:
Strategic hiring clarity for EU & Nordics tech and gaming leaders
Subheadline:
TALINTEL helps CEOs, CTOs, and Heads of Talent de-risk critical leadership hires, build resilient talent pipelines, and turn hiring into a repeatable advantage, not a last-minute fire drill.
Micro-proof line (small text under subheadline):
20+ years leading global talent across tech and AAA gaming in NA, EU, and APAC.
Primary CTA button text:
Schedule a 30-minute diagnostic
Micro-reassurance text below CTA:
No pitch. A focused review of your current hiring risks and decisions.

"WHAT WE DO" SECTION
Replace the section intro paragraph with:
TALINTEL works with companies where hiring outcomes matter and the margin for error is low.
We focus on decision quality, clarity, and execution, especially when stakes are high and timelines are tight.
This is not high-volume recruiting or theoretical advisory.
It is senior-level talent judgment applied where it has the greatest business impact.

SERVICES (Keep existing service cards / layout)
Replace service copy as follows:
Process Optimization
Reduce decision time without lowering the bar.
We identify where hiring processes break under pressure and redesign them to produce consistent, high-quality decisions, without adding unnecessary steps or tools.
Best for teams scaling engineering, product, or leadership under time constraints.
Fractional Talent Leadership (mark as Core offering if there is an existing visual option; otherwise text only)
Senior talent leadership when it matters most.
Embedded Head-of-Talent support for organizations navigating growth, restructuring, or transition, without committing to a full-time executive.
Best for post-funding scaleups, new studios, or leadership gaps.
Hiring Analytics & Forecasting
Turn hiring activity into business signal.
We translate hiring data into clear insight: where risk is building, where pipelines fail, and what decisions need attention now, not later.
Best for leadership teams who need clarity, not dashboards.
Executive Talent Search (Core offering)
Precision search for roles that cannot fail.
Targeted, discreet search for senior and leadership hires where judgment, alignment, and long-term fit matter more than speed alone.
Best for executives, technical leaders, and mission-critical roles.
Talent & Market Intelligence
Make talent decisions with real market context.
We map talent availability, compensation dynamics, and competitive hiring behavior to support expansion, location strategy, and critical role planning.
Best for market entry, AI hiring, or organizational redesign.
Automation & AI Implementation
Use technology to support decisions, not replace them.
We help teams deploy automation and AI where it genuinely reduces friction and improves signal, without creating noise or false confidence.
Best for organizations overwhelmed by tools but lacking clarity.
Bridge statement (keep as blockquote or italic if present):
Each engagement is designed around real constraints: market conditions, internal capacity, and business priorities.

"WHY TALINTEL" SECTION
Replace headline with:
Most hiring problems are not effort problems.
They are decision problems.
Replace body copy with:
TALINTEL helps leadership teams:

See the talent market clearly before committing budget or headcount
Understand where pipelines break and why
Reduce variance and bias in hiring decisions
Build systems that perform under pressure, not just on paper

Outcome line:
The result: faster cycles, better hires, and fewer surprises when it matters most.

CREDIBILITY / METRICS
If counters currently show placeholder values (e.g. 0 years), replace them with text-only credibility statements:

20+ years leading global talent initiatives
Experience across North America, Europe, and APAC
Senior-level focus on quality over volume
Initial response within 24 to 48 hours

Do NOT fabricate metrics.

"FOR CANDIDATES" SECTION
Compress copy to:
Headline:
For Candidates
Body:
TALINTEL works with candidates in a focused and intentional way.
We engage only where there is real hiring intent, clear context, and a defined decision path.
You can expect:

Clear communication and realistic expectations
Roles grounded in actual business needs, not speculation
A process designed for signal, not noise

Important note:
We do not run mass outreach or generic pipelines.
If we are in touch, there is a real role, real intent, and an active decision process.

ABOUT TALINTEL
Replace intro with:
TALINTEL is a consulting and advisory firm focused on talent intelligence and execution for leadership teams in complex, competitive markets.
We operate at the intersection of data, systems, and senior judgment to help companies hire with confidence, especially when the cost of getting it wrong is high.

VALUES (keep layout)
Clarity
Focus on the roles, decisions, and signals that actually matter.
Intelligence
Data is only valuable when it improves judgment and action.
Structure
Strong hiring systems rely on consistency and follow-through under pressure.
Accountability
We work as partners. Outcomes matter.

OUR STORY
Replace with the following compressed version:
TALINTEL was built around a pattern seen repeatedly across industries and growth stages.
Companies were investing heavily in hiring: new tools, larger teams, external support. Yet still making slow, inconsistent decisions that didn't hold up when pressure increased.
The issue was rarely effort or budget.
It was clarity.
Teams had data but no shared framework. Leaders had opinions but no aligned decision process. Systems existed, but failed when stakes rose.
TALINTEL exists to fix that by bringing structure, intelligence, and execution to the decisions that determine hiring outcomes.
